# Coffee Orders Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents the analysis of coffee sales data over a period of time using Microsoft Excel. The data was first extracted from an Excel file and then followed by a data cleaning process where duplicate valus were removed and the number formats were adjusted to formats such as dollar amount and kg measurements for better understanding and readability and the data range was converted into a pivot table.

A timeline for date and slicers were created to allow for dynamic filtering in the dashboard by roast type, size and loyalty card usage. This dashboard visualizes some key metrics which includes sales over time, by country, and the top 5 valuable customers providing insights which can facilitate decision-making.
